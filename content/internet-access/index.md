        In the rural communities in Sudan and South Sudan, there is no cellular network, print media, internet cafe, internet access and libraries.

        The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal Number 9 Target C recognizes the need to "increase access to information and communication technology and aim to provide universal access and affordable access to the internet in least developed countries by 2020".

        NOEIT targets the following beneficiaries:

        1. Primary students
        2. Secondary students
        3. Teachers
        4. Graduates
        5. Entrepreneurs
        6. Journalists
        7. Professionals in different field.
