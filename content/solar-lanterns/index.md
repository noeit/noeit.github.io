      text: |
        ### The Challenge

        Remote communities in Sudan and South Sudan lack electricity infrastructure. Families rely on torches and kerosene lamps for light—expensive, dangerous, and insufficient for studying or productive work after dark.

        ### Our Solution

        NOEIT distributes portable solar lanterns to community members—clean, renewable light that costs nothing to operate after the initial distribution. Solar lanterns provide reliable illumination for studying, working, and daily activities without ongoing fuel costs or fire hazards.

        ### Who Benefits

        Our solar lantern program prioritizes:

        - **Primary School Students** — Children who need light to complete homework and study in the evening hours
        - **Secondary School Students** — Older students preparing for exams and pursuing academic goals
        - **Elderly Community Members** — Seniors who need reliable light for safety and daily activities

        ### Why Solar

        Solar lanterns align with NOEIT's commitment to sustainable, environmentally-friendly solutions:

        - **Zero Operating Cost** — Charged by the sun, free to use
        - **Environmentally Friendly** — No emissions, no fuel consumption
        - **Safe** — No fire risk from flames or kerosene
        - **Reliable** — Consistent light whenever needed
        - **Durable** — Built to last in challenging conditions

        ### The Impact

        A simple solar lantern transforms a student's ability to learn. With light to study after dark, children can complete their education and build better futures. For elderly community members, reliable light means safety, independence, and dignity.
