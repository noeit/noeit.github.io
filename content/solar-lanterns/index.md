      title: The Challenge
      text: |
        Remote communities in Sudan and South Sudan lack electricity infrastructure. Families rely on torches and kerosene lamps for light—expensive, dangerous, and insufficient for studying or productive work after dark.

        NOEIT distributes portable solar lanterns to community members—clean, renewable light that costs nothing to operate after the initial distribution. Solar lanterns provide reliable illumination for studying, working, and daily activities without ongoing fuel costs or fire hazards.
