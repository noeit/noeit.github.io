My name is Fatima, a teacher by Profession and currently working as women protection and empowerment activist. I grew up in an unfamiliar culture where girls/women are viewed as an asset in their families and communities, Marriage as a priority, education for Boys and upholding cultural norms positive or negative is of great value. Is a painful experience that other girls and women I have ever experienced though my family was slightly different and as a result I am who I am today. I felt proud of myself when I got my first bachelor's degree after many years of struggle in a childhood marriage and dropped out of school. Feeling satisfied of oneself is one movement of those where words cannot express the sensation. Today am a mother of two Kids, a girl, and a boy and sure that their lives will be 95% better than of my age mates and I those time. I believe in Change, and I have a confident enough to make Change in the lives of those who will need Change. I believe in Gender Equality as the beginning of Change in every society.
